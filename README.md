# Netflix Analysis

Introduction:

Netflix is one of the largest streaming platforms that provides users with a catalogue of movies and tv shows. Throughout the years, Netflix has been struggling as their stock has been down over 60 percent year to date. This kept many people wondering if Netflix is dying. What is the cause for this rapid decline? It could be a list of varity reasons such as cutting content, rasisng prices, or not letting users share their passwords. In this project, I want to gain more insight towards the content quality that Netflix offers. How big is their content category? How many content does Netflix release year to year? Does their content category contain more movies than tv shows? The answer to these questions will help us understand the decline in subscribers.
